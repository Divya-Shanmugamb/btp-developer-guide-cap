# Introduction
[Observability](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/dev-guide-operate-cap) helps to take data-driven informed decisions based on runtime Observability telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces, events, ...) and provides insights into SAP & customer services and systems to understand and improve efficiency, scalability, resilience, and availability.

When you seek for fully detailed observability data of your application, you can use [SAP Cloud Logging](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-logging/cloud-logging/what-is-sap-cloud-logging?locale=en-US). SAP Cloud Logging allows you to slice and dice logs, metrics, and traces in order to analyze functional and performance behaviour of your BTP workload on Cloud Foundry and Kyma.
